					<h2>Preferences: Differences</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Created a new tab called "Difference" and moved the difference specific preferences from the "Methods" tab.</li>
						<li>Added the ability to specify file and folder names that will be ignored when checking for differences between the structure and a copy previously saved to disk. This is useful if you use an external source code control for the files.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Code Analysis Window: Complexity Analysis</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Added a search field to help locate method names that start with what have typed.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Code Analysis Window: Index Analysis</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The "Analyse Indexes" button now offers you a choice to avoid doing a full index analysis and be able to quickly get the counts on the field usage. You can still do a full analysis by making that 2nd choice.</li>
						<li>Implemented a <b>massive</b> optimization. The analysis for determing which fields are used is now part of the persisted stats for each method. This analysis occurs only when a method has been updated since the last time analysis was done.</li>
						<li>Using the "Detailed Reports" button has been optimized. The reports are produced very quickly now. Almost immediately.</li>
						<li>Added "Sum", "Min" and "Max" to the commands that are considered during analysis of field usage. <em>Feature request by Thomas Maul.</em></li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Code Analysis Window: Method Differences</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Added a new option for the DIFF engine to ignore blank lines. Essentially all blank lines will be removed from the methods prior to comparison.</li>

					<h2>Code Analysis Window: Folder Differences</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed a bug where the text displayed in the "Compare Against Remote Folder" was not accurate after selecting which folder to compare.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Code Analysis Window: Exporting Methods as HTML</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The 4D Project Method Comments take precedence over the comments within the method. If there are 4D Project Method Comments, then only those will appear in the HTML documenation.</li>
						<li>The export will output any parameters that take the form of "${n}" where "n" is a number. <em>Feature request by Lutz Epperlein.</em></li>
						<li>Fixed issue where the $0 would not be outputed on the blue header line of the method's html.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Code Analysis Window: Exporting Structure</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>When exporting the table and field information, the setting for appending date and time on the form properties is recognized.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Code Analysis Window: Method Comments</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Added a new "Method Commments" tab. This tab allows you to update the 4D "Method Comment" on project methods and have it based on comments from the top of the method. This is useful if you are compiling a component and are wanting useful tips to appear on the shared methods.</li>

					<h2>Method Analysis Engine</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Completely refactored the code that does all the analysis of the methods reducing complexity and removing duplication.</li>
						<li>The results of the analysis is now persisted to the local disk along with the other Code Analysis component preferences.</li>
						<li>Refreshing the analysis only performs updates on the methods that have been updates since the last time the analysis was run. This is determined by using the modification data and time as reported by 4D.</li>
						<li>Exposed "<code>MethodStats_RecalculateAll</code>" to the host database. Calling this method does a full recalculation of the method statistics in the host database.</li>
						<li>Exposed "<code>MethodStats_RecalculateModified</code>" to the host database. Calling this method does a recalculation of the method statistics of the methods in the host database that have been modified since the last recalculation.</li>
						<li>Improved detection algorithm used to determine if the required project form has been copied to the host database prior to exporting the properties. The message displayed to the user is improved as well.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Complexity</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Added a "<i>View Graphs</i>" button that is enabled once the code has been analysed. Pressing this button will open a dialog that will allow you to view a graph of the # of methods by lines of code and # of methods by complexity. These graphs can be used to have a higher level view of some metrics of your code.</li>
						<li>The results of the last analysis is persisted and restored when the main Code Analysis window is opened.</li>
						<li>Holding down the option or alt key and pressing the "Analyse Code" button will bring up a prompt that will allow you to select if only the update methods or all the methods will be analysed.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Method DIFF</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed bug where a method diff window would not open if the method name matched an already running process. The process name is prepended with "diff:".</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Method Export</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Altered how methods are exported. The component will not do a full replace of the contents of the export folder. Only the method files that differ will be exported. The change has been made to improve the workflow when using external code repositories.</li>
						<li>Added a check to ensure that the folder the methods are being exported to is writable. An error is displayed if it is not.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Structure Export</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Added a "Index Field Stats". Using this button will perform a code scan of they entire code base and will save two reports to the default export folder. One report contains a full listing of the fields that are used in query statements along with a count and if the field is indexed or not. The 2nd report shows the methods (and line) that each field query is performed in.</li>
						<li>Fixed bug that caused no index information to be exported in the table/field info export file.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Methods That Are Shared With Host Database</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>"<code>Structure_SaveStructDefn2Folder</code>" is now shared with the host database. This method will export the structure definition to a file. See the Component API Docs for more information.</li>
						<li>"<code>Structure_ScanIndexedFieldUsage</code>" is a new method that is shared with the host database. This method will scan the host database for where fields are used in queries and produce a report that shows usage and if they are indexed or not. See the Component API Docs for more information.</li>
						<li>"<code>MethodStats_RecalculateAll</code>" is a new method that is shared with the host database. This method will recalculate all the method metrics that the component captures. The results are stored back to disk for future usage. See the Component API Docs for more information.</li>
						<li>"<code>MethodStats_RecalculateModified</code>" is a new method that is shared with the host database. This method will loads the previously method metrics and updates the metrics on the methods that have been updated since the last time the calculations where performed.

						<li>Extended the exporting of methods as text to also copy any specified extra folders.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Code Analysis Window</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Added a 2nd view of the method differences.
						The differences can now be viewed so that they appear vertically one after another (like shown on github) or horizontally.
						Use Command 1 and 2 to switch the views (control 1/2 on windows). The view is persisted in the preferences.</li>

					<h2>Quick Launcher</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Added a quick launcher window that can be set as floating or just a plain palette. From this quick launcher window you can export the methods to text files as well as open the main window for the component or the preferences.
						The window can be opened by calling the "<code>CA_ShowQuickLauncher</code>" method.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Preferences</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Split the preference on what to append to the folder containing the exported methods. The options are nothing, date only, date & time.</li>
						<li>Added a preference to control which line endings to use for the exports. CR, LF and CRLF are the options.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Method Difference Viewer</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Made some slight UI updates to the screen.</li>
						<li>Added ability to copy, using an Apply button, the method from disk into the 4D method. Note: Form methods can only be updated. They cannot be created this way.</li>
						<li>Fixed issue where the changes within a line would not be highlighted if the that line of the method contained a &lt;, &gt; or &amp;.</li>
						<li>Fixed issue where any html embedded in a line would be hidden if the that line of the method contained a &lt;, &gt; or &amp;.</li>
						<li>The DIFF parser will normalize the end-of-line character(s) before performing the DIFF. The result is that two files of identical content but with different EOLs will not show as having differences. This also applies to the differences tab as well.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Complexity Tab</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Added "Called" column that shows the number of times that method is called directly in 4D Code.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Differences Tab</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>The folder that was used to check for differences against is stored in the local structure preferences. The next time the Code Analysis window is opened, that last folder is restored so that a quick "Re-Check" button can be done.</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug in the "Create Method From File" so that the BOM in the UTF8 file is not imported as part of the code. The option to create a method from a file is part of the contextual menu when clicking on a method in the list of differences.</li>
						<li>Fixed a bug that caused the "Show File on Disk" pop-up menu option to not work. This option is part of the contextual menu when clicking on a method in the list of differences.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Structure Export Tab</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Fixed runtime errors that would occur when Exporting Properties. Apparently using pointers to local vars as parms to an EXECUTE METHOD is not a good idea.</li>
					</ul>
					<h2>Internal Changes</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Window locations are stored in a global preference file rather one preference file per structure that the CodeAnlysis component is installed in.</li>
						<li>The Preference dialog preference values are now tied to an internal project name that is generated the first time the CodeAnaysis component is used.
						This means that the preferences will persist if the host structure changes it's name. The internal project name is stored in the host structure's resource folder.</li>
